Detailed Summary for [Part 1-  End to End Azure Data Engineering Project | Project Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mECDWTYiKp4) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

This video explains a data engineering project using Azure technologies to build a complete end-to-end data project.

This video covers a complete end-to-end data engineering project using various Azure resources.
- Learn how to use different Azure resources like Issue Data Factory, Issue Synapse Analytics, Issue Data Bricks, Issue Data Lake, Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vault, and Power BI.
- The use case covered in this video is a popular one used by many companies for building data engineering projects.
- Including this project in your resume can be really helpful for clearing data engineering interviews.

The project involves migrating an on-premise SQL Server database to the cloud using Azure Data Factory.
- The data source for the project is an on-premise SQL Server database.
- The main reason for companies to move to the cloud is to migrate their traditional databases.
- The project will involve migrating six or seven tables from the database.
- The first step in the migration process is using Azure Data Factory.

Azure Data Factory is used to connect to an on-premise SQL Server database and move tables to Azure Data Lake Gen 2. Azure Databricks is used to transform the data.
- Azure Data Factory is an ETL tool mainly used for data ingestion.
- Azure Data Lake Gen 2 is the storage solution in Azure.
- Azure Databricks is a big data analytics tool used for high-end data analytics workloads.
- Azure Databricks can be used to write code in SQL, PySpark, or Python.
- Lake house architecture is an important concept covered in this project.

 Azure Data Lake is divided into multiple layers: bronze, silver, and gold
- Bronze layer is an exact copy of the data source and acts as the source of truth
- In case of any issues in subsequent data transformations, you can refer back to the bronze layer
- Data is then transformed in the bronze layer and loaded into the silver layer

Data transformation and cleaning process from bronze to gold layer using Azure tools
- In the bronze to silver layer, simple transformations like changing column names or data types can be done
- Data Engineers are responsible for cleaning and curating raw data into the most curated form, using Azure Databricks and Lakehouse architecture
- The final clean data is loaded into the gold layer using Azure Synapse Analytics

Data migration and analysis using Azure Synapse Analytics and Power BI
- Set up and load data into Azure Synapse Analytics, creating tables that mirror on-premise SQL database
- Further analysis of stored data using Power BI to generate reports and charts
- Incorporate security and governance tools such as Azure Active Directory for access management

Use Azure Key Vault to safely store and retrieve secrets
- Azure Key Vault can be used to store secrets like usernames and passwords
- Data Engineers can retrieve this information for real-time projects
- Using Azure Key Vault is the safest way to handle secret data

This project is about creating a data engineering pipeline.
- This pipeline retrieves the latest row from an on-premise SQL database and performs data transformation before loading it into another database.
- The pipeline is designed to reflect the new row in a Power BI report.
- The project covers different aspects of data sources, including their integration and building the pipeline.
- The video is divided into multiple sections, including environment setup, data ingestion, data transformation, data loading, and data reporting.
- The final part of the project is end-to-end testing of the pipeline.
